Configure a Project Template with Resource and Network Restrictions
You should be able to:

    Modify the default project template to automatically create limit ranges, resource quotas, and network policies.

    Create a TLS secret using the provided files.

    Mount a secret as a volume within an application.

    Create a passthrough route to an application.

    Configure an application to automatically scale.

As the student user on the workstation machine, use the lab command to prepare your system for this exercise.

Complete the following tasks:

  1)  As the admin user, update the OpenShift cluster to use a new project template. The project template must automatically create the network policy, limit range, and add quota resources for new projects. New projects must automatically have a label matching the name of the project. For example, a project named test has the name=test label.

    The following table guides you to the needed resources.
    Resource	Requirements
    Project	

        Includes a label with the name of the project.
    NetworkPolicy	

    Policy 1:

        Routes are accessible to external traffic; this means that traffic is allowed from pods in namespaces with the network.openshift.io/policy-group=ingress label.

    Policy 2:

        Pods in the same namespace can communicate with each other.

        Pods do not respond to pods that exist in a different namespace, except namespaces with the network.openshift.io/policy-group=ingress label.
    LimitRange	

        Each container requests 30 millicores of CPU.

        Each container requests 30 MiB of memory.

        Each container is limited to 100 millicores of CPU.

        Each container is limited to 100 MiB of memory.
    ResourceQuota	

        Projects are limited to 10 pods.

        Projects can request a maximum of 1 GiB of memory.

        Projects can request a maximum of 2 CPUs.

        Projects can use a maximum of 4 GiB of memory.

        Projects can use a maximum of 4 CPUs.
2) As the developer user, create a project named review-template. Ensure that the review-template project inherits the settings specified in the new project template. In the review-template project, create a deployment named hello-secure using the container image located at quay.io/redhattraining/hello-world-secure:v1.0.

3) As the developer user, create a TLS secret using the hello-secure-combined.pem certificate and the hello-secure-key.pem key located in the ~/DO280/labs/review-template/ directory. Use the logs from the failed hello-secure pod to determine the expected mount point for the certificate. Mount the TLS secret as a volume in the pod using the identified directory. Verify that the hello-secure pod successfully redeploys.

4) The hello-secure-combined.pem certificate is valid for a single host name. Use the openssl x509 command with the -noout and -ext 'subjectAltName' options to read the hello-secure-combined.pem certificate and identify the host name. As the developer user, create a passthrough route to the hello-secure service using the identified host name. Verify that the route responds to external requests.
Note

The x509(1) man page provides information on the openssl x509 command.
5) As the developer user, configure the hello-secure deployment to scale automatically. The deployment must have at least one pod running. If the average CPU utilization exceeds 80%, then the deployment scales to a maximum of five pods.
Note

You can use the script located at ~/DO280/solutions/review-template/test-hpa.sh to test that your deployment scales as expected.
